							First of all, something about myself. I am a computing student who aspires to be a software engineer or developer in future. Now, you may ask, why would you accept an internship position at Allianz because they are more of a financial institution rather than a software development company, it does not seem relevant to my career development plan. 
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="row r-pb">
					<div class="section-heading">
						<p class="fh5co-lead animate-box">
							Indeed, it does not. I doubted my decision of accepting this position at first too, but I changed my mind after all. It was a journey that I never anticipate before and I would like to share my experience and gratitude with you, maybe it may help you while you are struggling on your own path.

							I admit, at first glance, my job scope and most of the tasks I was assigned may not seem to be relevant to my career aspiration of being a software engineer or developer. However, through these tasks, I gained valuable skills and knowledge that will benefit me in my future career on a more general scale, these are some skills that the job market demands in every field. One of the most important skills I learnt is the application or adaptation of all my knowledge and skills into real-world practices. For instance, I have been learning video editing as a hobby for quite some time and Allianz Academy provided me with the chance to put my skills to a real-world test.

							Besides, I appreciated all the opportunities to deal with trainers, agency managers, agents and prospects, because I learned a lot of marketing and communication skills from my conversations with them. To name a few that might beneficial to my future career, customer needs discovery and identification skills which would come in handy when I would like to develop an application or program that aims to ease the life of my target audience.

				<div class="row r-pb">

While it may not have been the most obvious choice for a computing student, I am grateful for the opportunity and encourage others to consider opportunities outside of their comfort zone. It has helped me discover my strengths and interests, as well as my areas for improvement. It has also inspired me to make a positive impact on people's lives in my own field of study. I am grateful for all the life lessons and values that I have gained from this internship that will benefit me for a long time. I'm truly grateful for this opportunity to be part of Allianz.
